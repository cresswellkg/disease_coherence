# ToDo

- P-values for disease coherence for n=10,000

- Methods, "Permutation test of slopes”, “Manuscript.Rmd”, line 188.
    - TBD, random network creation, simplest is to sample pairs of genes until getting the needed number of non-zero interactions

- Need `biogrid_perm_cluster.R`, `string_perm_cluster.R` and `string_filt_perm_Cluster.R`, in decent form

- `Permutation_Results`
