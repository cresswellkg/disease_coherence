# ToDo

- P-values for disease coherence

- Given the new method (combining KEGG, GOCC, Reactome), “Coherence_Calculations_New.Rmd” needs to be updated, where p-value RDS objects are handled, from line 100.

- Methods, "Permutation test of slopes” section needs your rewriting. “Manuscript.Rmd”, line 188.
