# ToDo

- Figure 1 and 2

- Table 1 and all supplementary tables

## Questions

- Is this description accurate?

- `Connectivity_Comparison.Rmd` - Calculation of  degree distributions and unnormalized coherence for disease related data. Includes old analyisis of random networks and KEGG pathways. Results are produced for Biogrid and STRING.

My understanding, it just makes PPI rds objects, no?


- Do we need, where it is, this file?

- `efo.owl` - Experimental factor ontology file. Used to generate categories
