### Coherence of Molecular Mechanisms in Genes Identified Through GWAS In Major Human Disease and Traits

This project involves quantification of coherence of the molecular networks formed by disease-associated genes. A metric for coherence is defined as a ratio between the number of internal and external protein-protein interactions. To date, a major problem with network size affecting the coherence has been solved. The solution includes the creation of size-matched references for high and low coherences (KEGG and random networks, respectively). The project is currently in results-generating and manuscript writing stage.
